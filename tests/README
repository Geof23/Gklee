	A python file which reads the expected.txt file for a test and compares
	the expected output to that of Gklee and reports discrepancies.

     <any directory>
     	  Every directory has a .cu file and an expected.txt file
	  	  *.cu
			This file is the cuda code in question
		expected.txt
			This is the list of expected traits of the .cu file

		options.txt
			gklee-nvcc options for the file

Entries in expected.txt are newline delimited and from the list below:
	volatile            // missed volatile declaration
	read write          //
	benign read write   //
	write write         // 
	benign write write  //
