 "Closed quantifier-free formulas built over an arbitrary expansion of the
  BV_ArraysEx signature with free function and predicate symbols over
  the sorts of BV_ArraysEx.  Formulas in ite terms must satisfy the same
  restriction as well, with the exception that they need not be closed (because
  they may be in the scope of a let expression).
